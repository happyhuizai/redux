/**

 *
 * @template S Combined state object type.
 *
 * @param reducers An object whose values correspond to different reducer
 *   functions that need to be combined into one. One handy way to obtain it
 *   is to use ES6 `import * as reducers` syntax. The reducers may never
 *   return undefined for any action. Instead, they should return their
 *   initial state if the state passed to them was undefined, and the current
 *   state for any unrecognized action.
 *
 * @returns A reducer function that invokes every reducer inside the passed
 *   object, and builds a state object with the same shape.
